On November 25th, Turkey started including asymptomatic cases in their daily increases. On December 10th, Turkey provided a large case dump to bring the total historical reporting in line with the new reporting standard. This increase in cases has led to large distortions in our daily case graphs for the globe and Turkey itself. Within the arcgis platform, there is not a straightforward means of disguising this spike without altering the underlying data. We have reached out the Turkish Ministry of Health for back distribution but as of yet have not received a response and the data is still not yet publicly available.",
