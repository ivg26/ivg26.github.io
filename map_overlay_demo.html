        LNG demand rises 2% in 2020 despite COVID-19
      </h1>

    <p class="selectionShareable">
      The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has grown by about 2% in 2020
      compared to 2019 despite the negative impacts of COVID-19 on overall
      energy sector, experts said at a virtual meeting on Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p class="selectionShareable">
      Speaking at World LNG Virtual Summit and Awards, Vice President of Global
      LNG Marketing at ExxonMobil's Alex Volkov said, "it's not a huge growth,
      but still a solid growth" considering major disruptions as some countries
      implemented lockdowns that led to sharp demand declines and supply chain
      breakdowns.

        Volkov said some of the regions and countries enjoyed much stronger
        growth, including China by about 10%, India at least 15% and Europe by
        about 5%.

      <p class="selectionShareable">
        He said the reason for LNG industry's well-adjusted and positive
        reaction was positive strategic relationships that "key buyers allowed
        us to address those issues in ways that are mutually beneficial for both
        parties."
      </p>
      <p class="selectionShareable">
        He added that LNG sector is expected to grow by 3 to 4% per year to
        2030.

        - 'Natural gas provides cost-effective solution'
      </p>
      <p class="selectionShareable">
        Recalling that natural gas plays a key role in lower carbon energy
        future, Volkov said can help reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by up to
        60% and in a cost-efficient manner in all sectors versus other fossil
        fuels.
      </p>
      <p class="selectionShareable">
        "In the long run, natural gas also provides a cost-effective solution
        for the intermittency, a weak point of renewables. Whenever wind or
        solar utilization is low, natural gas can step in, sometimes in just a
        few minutes, and take their place and power generation stack," he said.
      </p>
      <p class="selectionShareable">
        Volkov noted that natural gas can also be a lower cost solution within
        the appropriate policy framework.
      </p>
      <p class="selectionShareable">
        "This year actually demonstrated exactly how affordable it can be with
        some of the lowest prices for LNG in the last 15 - 20 years. And, we can
        already observe a significant and positive demand response," he said.
